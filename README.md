## Masters Thesis
### North Hills East Resiliency Plan 
The study assessed North Hills East's resilience across various factors such as demographics, housing and land use, transportation characteristics, environmental indicators, streetscape and greenery etc. It subsequently presented a strategic plan that the community can employ to reinforce its physical and societal infrastructure, enabling it to effectively navigate and thrive in the face of immediate and long-term challenges. Additionally, the study offered recommendations based on historical research, expert consultations, GIS data analysis, public meetings, and community input to address critical concerns.

## Projects
### Transportation Planning Decisions Impacts on Public Health Objectives
This article explores different public health impacts namely traffic crashes, vehicle pollution, physical activity, and lack of accessibility of transportation planning decisions. Transportation infrastructures, travel modes, and travel behavior can affect public health both positively and negatively again directly and indirectly. Generally, conventional planning tends to consider crashes and pollution but ignores the health problems due to lower active transportation and the additional impacts of increased vehicle mileage. Though health impacts are large compared with other impacts, yet other issues receive greater consideration causing the increased crashes or pollution. More comprehensive analysis of health impacts can change planning decisions. Integrating health objectives into transport planning can be one of the most cost-effective ways to improve public health, resulting in a more efficient and diverse transport system.

### The Impact of Residential Land Use Regulation on Housing Price in the US in 21st Century
This article studies the impact of land use constraints on the housing price in the U.S. in the 20-year timeline of 2001 to 2021. In a sample covering 35 states in the US with the highest median housing price from January 2001 to April 2021, the paper finds that more restrictive residential land use regulations and geographic land constraints are linked to the larger booms in housing prices. Correlation and OLS Regression analysis were performed for determining the correlation between the land use constraints and housing price and the significance of these correlations respectively. Contrary to prior literature, our findings indicate an insignificant link between vacant land supply and housing price decline. Future research should focus on micro level jurisdiction, proportion of mortgage loan denial, and undevelopable lands for more sensible results.

### The Environmental Impacts of Electric Vehicles
Governments and automakers promote electric vehicles (EVs) as a crucial solution to reduce oil consumption and combat climate change. EVs have faced a persistent question: Are they as green as advertised? Policies focusing on EVs have been implemented to combat the transportation sector's expansion and position as the second-largest energy consumer in the United States. Global sales of EVs have surpassed 10 million units in 2022, with China, Europe, and the US leading the market. The demand for battery materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel has increased significantly, emphasizing the need for responsible mining and processing. Establishing a strong US lithium-battery supply chain is vital for maintaining global dominance in efficiency and cost reduction.

### Equity Analysis in Access to Public Transport for Vulnerable Groups in the City of Los Angeles
This article studies the equity of public transit accessibility of different cohorts including low-income populations, elderly, non-white, females, unemployed, and households without a car to jobs in the City of Los Angeles. Census tracts were categorized into two groups regarding the availability of bus stops and metro stations. Correlation and OLS Regression analysis were performed for determining the correlation between these cohorts and public transport usage and the significance of these correlations respectively. Correlation analysis results show that these groups have a significant correlation with public transport usage. However, the results of the OLS Regression indicate that gender and age are statistically significant whereas vehicle ownership is statistically insignificant. Future research should focus on public perception, conditions of connecting roads, different destinations, and more disadvantaged groups for more sensible results.

### The Experience of Bangladeshi Immigrants with The Healthcare System in San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, California
This study aims to examine the healthcare experience of Bangladeshi immigrants in San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, California. Research has shown that immigrants face various challenges with the healthcare system, and a lack of research exists on the experiences of Bangladeshi immigrants. The study aims to provide an overview of the challenges faced by Bangladeshi immigrants, such as language barriers, cultural disparities, accessibility to good quality health information, and mental health issues. The purpose of this grounded theory study is to explore the healthcare experience for Bangladeshi immigrants in San Fernando Valley, particularly the challenges they face, to inform improvement projects that can enhance healthcare services for everyone.
